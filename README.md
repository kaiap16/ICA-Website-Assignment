# Header
- header.php contains the necessary structure to create the layout of the navigation bar and search field at the top of the screen. It is mainly written in HTML and PHP (for functionality of search field). The !DOCTYPE declaration is used to specify the document is written in HTML. 
- Within the _head_ tags, is the wp_head() function, this prints scripts or data in the head tag on the front end.
- Using bootstrap's column system, the site uses container-fluid to make sure the content adapts to fit the screen in use as needed. wp_nav_menu() is used within the _nav_ tags to display custom menus on the website. The last column in the navbar contains a PHP function that calls/uses a search bar; get_search_form(true).

# Stylsheets
- With regards to styling, the theme makes use of three separate stylesheets:
  
	- bootstrap.css -> contains all CSS used by bootstrap
	- custom.css -> contains all CSS created by the theme creator and are specific to this theme
	- wpcore.css -> contains all CSS code that are applied automatically when building a WordPress theme

In custom.css, fonts for the theme, spacing, colours and button, navbar and sidebar styling are all applied 

# Sidebars
sidebars.php is used to register the functions for sidebars. Registering a sidebar involves creating a designated area on your theme where users can add widgets. Widgets are small blocks that perform specific functions, such as displaying recent posts, categories, or custom content. At the bottom of the file functions are hooked to the function using _add_action('widgets_init', 'function id');_
